Important its made on springboot so need springboot to turn it on, this is a playlist youtube downloader that download to .zip, done it with 2 challenges for me, 1 doing it fast(being functional and having the requirment) and second learning how to ask the IA for a solid product, wanted to learn how to use better the tools; the repo include a small bat for downloading and installing yt-dlp and ffmpeg; no bdd required only xampp and port 8080 free; it only require the url of the channel and the url of the playlist, the program its lightweight, its on spanish but its intuitive;
